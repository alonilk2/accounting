AI-First SaaS Accounting Platform for Israeli Businesses – Technical Documentation
System Overview and Goals
This platform is a cloud-native, AI-first SaaS accounting system targeting small-to-medium Israeli businesses. It covers end-to-end financial operations (sales, purchasing, inventory, banking) plus POS and recurring billing. The system automates tedious workflows—invoice processing, data entry, reconciliations—improving efficiency, accuracy and compliance

. AI integrations (e.g. OCR, LLMs) accelerate tasks like invoice scanning and reporting. Crucially, it fully supports the Israeli Tax Authority “מבנה אחיד” format (ver. 1.31). The goal is a unified platform where users (owners, bookkeepers, accountants) manage accounting seamlessly, generate official reports, and use AI assistants to save time and prevent errors. Key objectives include: high automation of routine tasks, real-time insights, multi-device access (including a POS interface), and strict adherence to Israeli accounting laws. By leveraging AI (Form Recognizer, OpenAI GPT) the platform will automate invoice/receipt entry and assist with queries and reporting, giving businesses smarter financial control

numeric.io
. A modular design ensures that core accounting (chart of accounts, ledger) forms the MVP, with specialized modules (POS, manufacturing, AI features) rolled out iteratively. Regulatory compliance (income tax reporting, VAT, etc.) is baked in: the system can export mandated files (INI.TXT, BKMVDATA.TXT) in the exact format required by the Israeli Tax Authority.
Technical Specifications
Database Schema
The backend uses a relational database (Azure SQL) with a normalized schema. Key tables and relationships include:
Users: (id PK, name, email, password_hash, role_id FK → Roles). Stores all system users. Each user has a Role (owner, accountant, etc.) controlling permissions.
Roles: (id PK, name, description). Defines roles like BusinessOwner, Accountant, Bookkeeper, AI_Assistant. Tied to RBAC rules
jit.io
.
Companies (Tenants): (id PK, name, israel_tax_id, address, currency, etc.). Supports multi-tenancy: each client organization has a record. All financial data (invoices, accounts) link to one Company.
ChartOfAccounts: (id PK, company_id FK, account_number, name, type (Asset/Liability/Equity/Revenue/Expense), parent_account_id). Represents the general ledger accounts. Hierarchical (parent-child) design allows groups.
Customers: (id PK, company_id FK, name, address, contact, tax_id, etc.). Sales customers.
Agents: (id PK, company_id FK, name, commission_rate, contact_info). Sales agents or resellers, if used.
Suppliers: (id PK, company_id FK, name, address, contact, tax_id, etc.). For procurement.h
Items (Products): (id PK, company_id FK, sku, name, unit, cost, price, current_stock_qty, reorder_point). Defines sellable/buyable inventory items.
InventoryBOM: (parent_item_id, component_item_id, quantity). (Optional) Bill of Materials for manufacturing-type items.
InventoryTransactions: (id PK, company_id FK, item_id FK, date, qty_change, transaction_type (sale, purchase, adjustment, production), ref_id FK). Records all stock movements (sales shipments, receipts, production, adjustments). Maintains current stock via summing qty_change.
SalesOrders/Invoices: (id PK, company_id FK, customer_id FK, agent_id FK, date, due_date, total_amount, status). A sales document (quote or invoice).
SalesOrderLines: (id PK, order_id FK, item_id FK, quantity, unit_price, tax_rate, line_total). Line items for SalesOrders.
Receipts/Payments Received: (id PK, company_id FK, invoice_id FK, date, amount, payment_method). Tracks customer payments.
PurchaseOrders/Bills: (id PK, company_id FK, supplier_id FK, date, total_amount, status). A purchase document or vendor bill.
PurchaseOrderLines: (id PK, purchase_id FK, item_id FK, quantity, unit_cost, line_total).
Payments (to Suppliers): (id PK, company_id FK, purchase_id FK, date, amount, payment_method). Vendor payments.
StandingOrders: (id PK, company_id FK, customer_id FK, frequency (e.g. monthly), next_date, amount, description). Recurring invoices for subscriptions/leases.
POS_Sales: (id PK, company_id FK, pos_terminal_id FK, cashier_user_id FK, date_time, total_amount, payment_method). Records of point-of-sale transactions.
POS_SaleLines: (id PK, pos_sale_id FK, item_id FK, quantity, unit_price).
AuditLog: (id PK, company_id FK, user_id FK, action, timestamp, details). Tracks all critical user actions for audit.
Relationships: Customers/Suppliers link to Companies; orders/invoices link to customers/suppliers; line items link to orders; inventory transactions tie items to operations. Multi-tenant isolation is achieved by scoping records (all tables with company_id FK). Data encryption at rest and row-level encryption (by tenant) can be applied as per Azure best practices

jit.io
.
API Specifications
The platform exposes a RESTful JSON API over HTTPS, using OAuth2/JWT authentication (Azure AD or custom token issuer)
learn.microsoft.com
learn.microsoft.com
. All endpoints require a valid bearer token. Input and output JSON is validated against schemas; errors return standard HTTP codes (400 for validation, 401/403 auth, 500 server error). The API adheres to typical CRUD patterns with the following key endpoints (examples):
POST /api/auth/login – Authenticate user (email/password or SSO) and return JWT token.
GET /api/users – List users (admin only). POST /api/users to create, PUT /api/users/{id} to update, DELETE /api/users/{id}. Roles/permissions enforced via RBAC.
GET /api/customers – List customers; supports filters/paging. POST /api/customers create, PUT /api/customers/{id}, DELETE /api/customers/{id}.
GET /api/suppliers, POST /api/suppliers, etc. Similarly for agents, items, inventory.
Sales Module: GET /api/sales/orders, POST /api/sales/orders (create invoice/order), GET /api/sales/orders/{id}, PUT/DELETE for update/cancel. POST /api/sales/orders/{id}/lines to add line items, or include lines in creation payload.
Payments: POST /api/sales/orders/{id}/payment to record receipt for an invoice, GET /api/sales/orders/{id}/balance.
Purchasing: GET/POST /api/purchase/orders, analogous to sales. Add lines via POST /api/purchase/orders/{id}/lines.
POS: POST /api/pos/sales to create a POS sale (from a tablet or register), with lines. GET /api/pos/sales/{id}.
Standing Orders: GET/POST /api/standing-orders to manage recurring invoices; a scheduler service in backend will process them.
Inventory: Endpoints to adjust stock (POST /api/inventory/adjust), and view current stock (GET /api/inventory/items/{id}).
Compliance Export: POST /api/compliance/export – triggers generation of the INI.TXT/BKMVDATA.TXT files for a given date range (body includes startDate/endDate).
AI Services: POST /api/ai/scan-receipt – accepts an image, calls Azure Form Recognizer, returns extracted data. POST /api/ai/query – sends a user’s natural-language finance question to a GPT-based assistant and returns a reply.
All APIs enforce role-based access (e.g. only an Accountant or Owner can create accounts or exports)
jit.io
. Validation ensures required fields (amounts, dates, IDs) are correct and numeric/format constraints (e.g. tax ID length). Errors from the tax authority (compliance module) are returned with details.
AI-First Capabilities and Integration Points
The platform embeds AI in key workflows to streamline finance tasks:
Document OCR & Data Extraction: Use Azure Form Recognizer (Document Intelligence) to parse invoices and receipts. For example, the prebuilt receipt model extracts merchant name, date, tax, totals, line items etc. from a photo/scan
learn.microsoft.com
. Similarly, an invoice model can extract vendor details and line items. This eliminates manual entry: users upload an image or PDF of a receipt/invoice and the AI auto-populates the transaction fields. According to Microsoft, the receipt OCR model “analyzes and extracts key information… such as merchant name, transaction date, tax, and total”
learn.microsoft.com
. This data feeds directly into PurchaseOrders or SalesReceipts.
Smart Accounting Assistant (Chatbot): Integrate with OpenAI GPT (via Azure OpenAI or OpenAI API) to answer finance questions and automate text tasks. For example, a user can ask “What was last quarter’s revenue?” or “Generate a summary of this month’s expenses.” The system sends the data or question to GPT-4o, which returns insights or drafts. GPT can also draft routine documents (like “Write an accounting policy for capitalizing fixed assets”). Even general tasks like categorizing transactions by context can be aided by AI. Studies show tools like ChatGPT can perform tasks like “data extraction, journal entry creation, policy writing, and spreadsheet formatting”
numeric.io
. In practice, the AI Assistant persona (see Personas) can receive natural-language requests and use data via the API or embedded prompts to generate reports or analysis
datacamp.com
numeric.io
. This could also include anomaly alerts (“Notify if expense categories suddenly spike”). Importantly, all AI suggestions require user review.
Machine Learning Analytics: Use AI/ML for forecasting and anomaly detection. For example, an ML model could analyze past sales to forecast next quarter’s revenue, or flag unusual vendor invoices (potential fraud). While details depend on data volume, the platform can optionally train models on the company’s historical data and present charts/trends (e.g. cash flow forecast, churn prediction). As noted by Sage, “AI revolutionizes decision-making” by quickly spotting trends and risks in large data sets
sage.com
.
Integration points: The system will call Azure Cognitive Services (Form Recognizer APIs) for OCR tasks, and Azure OpenAI Service (or OpenAI API) for language tasks. Standard REST calls handle images and text. These AI services run asynchronously and results are stored back in the system. For example, uploading a receipt triggers a background job that uses Form Recognizer; the extracted JSON populates a new PurchaseInvoice entity. Similarly, GPT-driven answers are displayed in the UI as chatbot messages. (All calls are rate-limited and logged for audit.) Overall, AI is an assistive layer – speeding data entry and insights – while core logic remains rule-based.
UI/UX Design and User Flows
The user interface is a modern web app (responsive, e.g. React front-end) with a clear, role-focused design. We follow usability principles of clarity and simplicity: only relevant information and controls are shown at each step
userpilot.com
. The interface uses Hebrew/English bilingual support as needed. Key sections (modules) and example user flows:
Dashboard: Upon login, the user sees a summary: bank balances, outstanding invoices, upcoming due bills, cash flow chart, and recent alerts. Quick links allow jumping into any module (e.g. “Create New Invoice”).
Customers & Sales: A business owner or accountant can manage clients and agents, create sales orders/invoices, and process payments. Flow: The user clicks “New Invoice”, selects a customer (or creates a new one), adds line items (auto-suggest products/prices), then clicks “Save”. The invoice posts to Accounts Receivable and Inventory is decremented. The user can then “Register Payment” to mark the invoice paid. Each step has clear buttons (Save, Pay, Print PDF). The UI shows totals (inc. VAT) and enforces entry of required fields.
Procurement & Suppliers: Similarly, users create purchase orders and receive shipments. Flow: Click “New Purchase Order”, pick supplier, add items and quantities. Upon receipt of goods, the user confirms “Receive” which increases stock and generates a bill for payment. Supplier invoices can be matched automatically if scanned with AI.
Inventory & Production: Users view stock levels on an “Inventory” page. They can adjust stock manually or create production orders (assembling multiple items). Flow: To manufacture an item, the user creates a Production Order specifying components (per BOM). Saving it consumes component stock and increases the finished good. Stock alerts appear when below reorder points. A separate “Inventory” menu shows current quantities by warehouse/location, and users can drill into transaction history for any item.
POS (Point of Sale): For retail shops, the POS module provides a cashier interface. Flow: The cashier selects items by code or scan, quantities auto-lookup price. The screen displays running total. After tender (cash/card), the system prints a receipt and simultaneously records a POS_Sale and updates inventory/accounts. The POS works in offline mode if connectivity drops (a known feature of cloud POS systems)
360connect.com
, syncing transactions when back online. Sales from all terminals aggregate in the cloud for unified reporting. Cloud-based POS means all data synchronizes automatically between devices
360connect.com
.
Collections & Standing Orders: Users can set up recurring invoices for subscriptions. Flow: Click “New Standing Order”, choose customer, items, and frequency (e.g. monthly). The system then automatically generates invoices on schedule. A calendar interface shows upcoming bills. For ad-hoc collections, an accountant can record a reminder email via the AI assistant or mark an invoice as “Deferred” in case of negotiations.
Throughout the UI, consistency is key: form layouts and menu structures are the same across modules. Navigation menus on the left list areas (Sales, Purchases, Inventory, POS, Reports, Compliance, etc.). Each form/page has breadcrumbs and clear headings. Error messages and tooltips help prevent mistakes. The design follows Nielsen’s heuristics: immediate feedback on actions, undo when possible, and minimal cognitive load
userpilot.com
. Wireframes and flow diagrams (omitted here) would detail each page’s layout; key UI components include data tables (searchable/filterable), detail panels, and action toolbars.
Compliance Module (מבנה אחיד Export)
Israeli law mandates that computerized accounting systems export full business data in a unified format (“מבנה אחיד”) upon request. This module implements that requirement by generating two files (INI.TXT and BKMVDATA.TXT) as specified in Income Tax Instruction 1.31.
Trigger & Inputs: Under a menu item “Export to Tax Authority” (הפקת קבצים במבנה אחיד), the user selects a date range (for multi-year systems) or fiscal year (for annual systems). The system prompts for the output directory. Using the “Open Format” module, it then compiles the data.
File Structure:
INI.TXT – Index file: Contains exactly one “header” record and one “summary” record. The header (record type A000) identifies the generation event (timestamp, company ID, version). The summary record (type Z900) lists the count of each record type included in BKMVDATA. For example, lines like INI.TXT B10019סך רשומות מסוג חשבונות בתנועות indicate totals. This aids auditors by showing how many invoices, ledger entries, inventory items, etc. were exported.
BKMVDATA.TXT – Business data file: Contains the detailed records. It starts with an A100 record (“opening structure”) and ends with a Z900 closing record. In between are blocks of records by type, following the spec table. Notable record types:
C100 (Document Header): One per invoice or credit note. Includes fields like invoice number, date, customer ID, total amount (inc. VAT).
D110 (Document Details): Line items for each document. Each line has item code, quantity, unit price, VAT code. These represent the contents of each invoice/receipt.
D120 (Payment Details): For cash receipts/payments (קבלה/תשלום), lists payment-specific entries.
B100 (“חשבונות בתנועות”): Transactions in the general ledger. Contains entries for each account’s debits and credits during the period. This includes all journal entries by account.
B110 (“חשבונות בספרים”): The chart of accounts list (account master data) with account numbers, names, types.
M100 (“פריטי מלאי”): Inventory master – each item with its code, description, unit, and current quantity. Inventory balance as of export time.
(Additional record types exist but the above are the core chapters.) The exact layouts (field lengths, formats) follow the published spec. For full details, see the official Structure Document.
Logic: When export is triggered, the system queries all accounts and transactions within the range: all SalesInvoices, PurchaseOrders/Bills, JournalEntries, InventoryTransactions, etc. It constructs the text records according to each record definition. Accounts and inventory lists (per Chapter B and C of Income Tax rules) must also be included. Dates and monetary fields use the prescribed formats (e.g. YYYYMMDD dates, fixed decimal places). VAT categories follow ISO 4217 and local tables as per Appendix. Each numeric field is padded or formatted exactly as required.
File Naming & Delivery: Per guidelines, the system creates a directory OPENFRMT on the chosen drive, then inside it a subfolder named with the first 8 digits of the company’s tax ID (without check digit), followed by a period and timestamp (MMDDhhmm) of generation. For example, if business ID is 002233445 and run on Sep 11, 2008 at 10:25, the folder might be 00223344.09111025. Inside this folder are the two files INI.TXT and BKMVDATA.TXT. A log file describing any errors is also saved. The user can then compress this folder and submit it for audit.
This compliance feature is critical for legality: “every computerized accounting software must be able to produce a file of items listed in Chapter B (inventory) and the double-entry system transactions” per Income Tax law amendment. By automating the “מבנה אחיד” export, the platform ensures clients can easily comply without manual effort.
User Stories and Personas
Business Owner (David, 45): Wants a high-level view of finances and easy bookkeeping. Story: “As an owner, I want to see key metrics (cash flow, profit) on my dashboard so I can make informed decisions.” He also needs to quickly generate tax reports and send invoices with minimal work. The AI assistant helps by generating a quarterly financial summary on demand.
Bookkeeper (Maya, 30): Handles day-to-day entries. Story: “As a bookkeeper, I want to import and classify invoices automatically, so I save time on data entry.” Maya uses the receipt scanning feature: she uploads a batch of receipts and the system uses OCR to fill in purchase entries. She also sets up standing orders (e.g. monthly rental invoice) once and lets the system auto-invoice them.
Accountant (Yossi, 50): External CPA reviewing client books. Story: “As an accountant, I want to verify the general ledger and export data for audit, ensuring tax compliance.” Yossi appreciates the compliance module (מבנה אחיד) – he can quickly get the INI/BKMV files and confirm all transactions are captured. He also uses the API to pull data into his analysis tools.
AI Assistant (Virtual Persona): A built-in helper chatbot. Story: “As an AI assistant, I want to answer user queries and execute simple tasks (like scheduling a report), to streamline their workflow.” This persona interfaces via chat: for example, a user types “Show me last month’s sales by product,” and the assistant fetches data from the database, aggregates it, and replies in natural language, possibly with an attached chart. The assistant also reminds users of deadlines (e.g. VAT payment) based on calendar and alert rules.

f22labs.com
, later releases can iterate on automation and intelligence features.
Security Architecture
Security is baked in at every layer. Key practices:
Authentication & RBAC: Use Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) or similar OAuth2 for SSO, enforcing multi-factor auth if desired
learn.microsoft.com
. All access is role-restricted: e.g. only Admins can change roles, only Accountants/Owners can export tax data or delete transactions
jit.io
. We apply the principle of least privilege. Sensitive operations (like changing chart of accounts) require elevated rights.
Data Encryption: All data in transit is HTTPS/TLS-only. At rest, we use Azure SQL Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) for database encryption. Each tenant’s data can use separate encryption keys (BYOK) so that one tenant cannot decrypt another’s data
learn.microsoft.com
. Files and backups are also encrypted. Any cached sensitive data (e.g. in Redis) is encrypted at rest.
Audit Logging: Every user action (logins, data edits, exports) is logged in the AuditLog table. Azure Monitor/Azure Sentinel can aggregate these logs. Regular audits review logs for anomalies (e.g. failed logins, data export). The design follows best practices: “configurable security settings (SSO, RBAC, audit logs) ensure enterprise-grade protection”
jit.io
.
Secure Defaults: Passwords are hashed with a strong algorithm. API endpoints throttle/validate input to prevent injection and abuse. We use an API Gateway or service mesh to enforce mTLS between services. OWASP guidelines are followed (input sanitization, CSRF tokens on forms).
Regulatory Compliance: Beyond tax law, we design for ISO 27001 or SOC 2 readiness. Personal data (if any) is stored only as needed. The system can be deployed in Azure Israel regions to satisfy data residency if required.
Redundancy & Backups: Regular automated backups of databases are encrypted and geo-replicated. Disaster recovery plans include failover replicas.
In summary, the security model emphasizes isolation (row-level and tenant-level) and traceability
jit.io
learn.microsoft.com
. Audit trails and encryption ensure that even if an attacker compromised part of the system, tenant data remains segregated and protected.
Deployment Architecture and Scaling
The platform is deployed on Microsoft Azure with a multitenant SaaS architecture leveraging managed services. A sample architecture is shown below: Figure: Example Azure multi-region SaaS architecture (source: Microsoft). Key Components:
Azure Front Door: Acts as the global entry point. It provides HTTPS termination, global load balancing, and WAF (Web Application Firewall) for edge security
learn.microsoft.com
. Front Door routes user requests to the nearest Azure region (for geo-redundancy).
Azure DNS: Manages custom domains for clients (each company can have its own portal domain). DNS directs traffic to Front Door.
Identity Provider: Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) issues OAuth tokens for authentication
learn.microsoft.com
. All web/API services trust Azure AD for auth and can implement fine-grained authorization.
Web/API Layer: Use Azure App Service (Web Apps) or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to host the application servers. App Service is preferred for fast deployment and autoscaling
learn.microsoft.com
. Each service is stateless behind App Gateway (internal LB), scaling out as load increases. Application Gateway in each region does internal load balancing and SSL end-to-end.
Database: Azure SQL Database (Elastic Pools) holds tenant data. Elastic Pools allow many company databases to share resources, scaling on demand
learn.microsoft.com
. Each tenant can be a separate database or use schema isolation; elastic pools optimize resource usage across tenants. The platform uses geo-replication for high availability.
Cache: Azure Cache for Redis speeds up frequent reads (e.g. session state, product catalogs). Redis is configured for clustering and is encrypted
learn.microsoft.com
.
Storage: Azure Blob Storage stores attachments (scanned receipts, PDF invoices). Blobs are automatically encrypted at rest.
AI Services: Azure Form Recognizer and Azure OpenAI run in the background via serverless Azure Functions or a dedicated worker pool. The app communicates with these via HTTPS. Processing is asynchronous: results are saved to the database.
Scaling: All tiers auto-scale. Front Door and App Gateway balance traffic across regions. App Service plans can scale based on CPU/memory. AKS pods scale per queue or KEDA triggers (for background jobs). The database uses elastic scaling. This ensures the system can handle hundreds of tenants and thousands of users simultaneously.
Using this Azure stack provides reliability and elasticity: it “integrates availability and regional failover” and “scales the business and logic tier… to prevent bottlenecks”
learn.microsoft.com
. Metrics and alerts (CPU, queue lengths, error rates) are monitored via Azure Monitor; scaling rules adjust instances automatically. By deploying in Azure, we also leverage built-in DevOps: continuous integration via Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions will automatically build, test and deploy each push to the cluster. Infrastructure-as-code (ARM or Bicep templates) defines networks, roles, and resource groups for reproducible deployments. This infrastructure meets the Azure Well-Architected Framework pillars (scalability, security, reliability) out of the box.
